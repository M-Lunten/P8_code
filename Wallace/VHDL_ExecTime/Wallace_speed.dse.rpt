Info: Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 4 of the 4 processors detected
Info: Selected device EP4CE115F29C7 for design "Wallace_speed"
Info: Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info: High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time

Warning: Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details
Info: Design uses memory blocks. Violating setup or hold times of memory block address registers for either read or write operations could cause memory contents to be corrupted. Make sure that all memory block address registers meet the setup and hold time requirements.
Warning: No exact pin location assignment(s) for 68 pins of 68 total pins. For the list of pins please refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings table in the fitter report.
Warning: Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'Wallace_speed.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.

Info: No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info: Deriving Clock Uncertainty. Please refer to report_sdc in the Timing Analyzer to see clock uncertainties.
Info: Timing requirements not specified -- quality metrics such as performance may be sacrificed to reduce compilation time.
